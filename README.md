# Mental-Health-Issues-Classfier-with-Texts
We use some basic machine learning and NLP technique to classify Mental Health Issues.


## Abstract

This machine learning project focuses on analyzing a mental health corpus dataset to classify the existence of mental health issues. The dataset contains a binary label, indicating the presence or absence of mental health issues. We mainly explored two classification methods, Random Forest and Neural Network. This project explores different text tokenization methods including CountVectorizer, Word2Vec, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), and DistilBERT. We used 1500 instances in the dataset to generate BERT and DistilBERT embeddings due to computational constraints. In combination with Feed-Forward Neural Networks, our results show a similar accuracy across simple and complex models, achieving an accuracy around 90%. The project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in identifying mental health issues through text, which can aid in early detection and timely intervention.

## About Dataset:

The Mental Health Corpus is a collection of texts related to people with anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. The corpus consists of two columns: one containing the comments, and the other containing labels indicating whether the comments are considered poisonous or not. The corpus can be used for a variety of purposes, such as sentiment analysis, toxic language detection, and mental health language analysis. The data in the corpus may be useful for researchers, mental health professionals, and others interested in understanding the language and sentiment surrounding mental health issues.
